<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

This project analyzes WhatsApp chat data to uncover communication patterns, user activity trends, and message dynamics. It provides actionable insights into engagement levels, most active users, and conversational behavior. A complete data pipeline was developed using SQL for data preprocessing, Python for analysis and text processing, and Streamlit for building an interactive dashboard for visualization.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="business-problem"></a>Business Problem</h2>

Understanding communication behavior is key to analyzing user engagement and interaction patterns. This project aims to:
- Identify the most active users and peak chat periods.
- Analyze message frequency, emoji usage, and media sharing trends.
- Examine user contribution to overall chat activity.
- Detect conversation dynamics such as streaks, response rates, and engagement gaps.
- Statistically validate differences in user activity and messaging behavior.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="data-cleaning--preparation"></a>Data Cleaning & Preparation</h2>

- Parsed raw WhatsApp text data to extract:
    - Date, time, user, and message components
- Removed system notifications, empty messages, and irrelevant lines
- Handled inconsistent timestamp formats (12-hour / 24-hour)
- Cleaned whitespace, emojis, and special characters for uniformity
- Created structured DataFrames for user-level and message-level analysis

<h2><a class="anchor" id="exploratory-data-analysis-eda"></a>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>

**Key Insights Identified:**
- Most active users contribute significantly to total message volume
- Peak chat activity observed during evenings and weekends
- Message frequency follows a right-skewed distribution (few users dominate activity)

**Content Analysis:**
- High frequency of emojis and media messages indicating casual communication
- Notable variation in average message length across users
- Detection of common keywords and recurring topics in conversations

**Temporal Trends:**
- Clear daily and monthly activity cycles
- Noticeable drops in activity during holidays or inactive periods

**Correlation Analysis:**
- Strong relationship between total messages and emoji usage
- Positive correlation between user activity and response rate
- Weak or inconsistent relation between message length and engagement duration

<h2><a class="anchor" id="research-questions--key-findings"></a>Research Questions & Key Findings</h2>

**1. Who are the most active users?**
- Top 10 users account for over 70% of total messages â†’ indicating uneven participation.

**2. When is the chat most active?**
- Peak activity observed between 8 PM â€“ 11 PM, especially on weekends.

**3. How does message content vary across users?**
- Significant differences in average message length, emoji usage, and media sharing frequency among users.

**4. What are the dominant communication trends?**
- Frequent use of emojis and short responses suggests informal, high-engagement conversations.

**5. Do activity patterns change over time?**
- Clear monthly and daily cycles, with dips during holidays or inactive periods.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="dashboard"></a>Dashboard</h2>

- The Streamlit Dashboard provides interactive insights, including:
    - User-wise message statistics (total messages, words, emojis, and media shared)
    - Daily, weekly, and monthly activity trends
    - Most active days and peak chat hours visualized through heatmaps
    - Emoji and word usage analysis to highlight expression patterns
    - User comparison tools for engagement and activity distribution
